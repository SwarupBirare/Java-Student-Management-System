# Java-Student-Management-System

## Description
The **Java-Student-Management-System** is a console-based application designed to efficiently manage student records. It allows users to perform essential operations such as adding, removing, searching, and displaying student data. This project demonstrates core Java programming concepts, including encapsulation (OOP), modular design, and the use of Java Collection (ArrayList).

## Features
- **Add Student Records:** Add new student data with unique IDs, names, and marks.
- **Remove Student Records:** Delete an existing student record using the student's ID.
- **Search Student Records:** Search for a student by their ID and view detailed information.
- **Display All Records:** View all student data in a neatly formatted table.
- **Interactive Menu:** A menu-driven interface for smooth navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Java
- **Concepts Applied:**
  - Encapsulation (OOP)
  - Modular Programming
- **Data Structures:** ArrayList (Java Collections Framework)

## Usage
The application provides the following options:
1. **Add:** Enter new student details.
2. **Remove:** Remove a student by their unique ID.
3. **Contain:** Check if a student exists by ID and display their details.
4. **Display:** Display all student records in a tabular format.
5. **Exit:** Terminate the program.
